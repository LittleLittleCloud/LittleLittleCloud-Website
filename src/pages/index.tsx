    description:`I am a senior software engineer at Microsoft Developer Division. I am passionate about developing software, contributing to open-source projects, and cat.

In Microsoft, I am primarily focused on AI for .Net and Visual Studio. I co-authored and contributed to [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), a multi-agent framework that enables developers to create AI agents with ease. I also work on [ML.Net](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning) \
and [ML.NET Model Builder](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder) to make machine learning more accessible to .Net developers.

In my free time, I enjoy creating projects that are fun and/or useful. And my current active projects are [StepWise](https://github.com/LittleLittleCloud/StepWise) and [Agent-ChatRoom](https://github.com/LittleLittleCloud/Agent-ChatRoom). \
Where \`StepWise\` is a agentic workflow engine that helps developers to code, visualize and execute workflows with ease. And \`Agent-ChatRoom\` is a multi-agent chat app that allows users to create and interact with autogen agents in a group chat.
